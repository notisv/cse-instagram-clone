Treegram is a simple Instagram-like Ruby-on-rails web app.

Users can create accounts with a username, password, and avatar.<br>
After logging in, users can upload photos to their account, follow other users, and add comments to posts.

## Treegram
- **Hover your mouse** over a user's post for a slideshow presentation of all their posts
